# javaSolidPrinciple
The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that were introduced by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) to help software developers design maintainable and scalable software systems. 
 ## The five principles are:
1. [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](#Single-Responsibility-Principle)
2. [Open-Closed Principle (OCP)](#Open-Closed-Principle)
3. [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](#Liskov-Substitution-Principle)
4. [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](#Interface-Segregation-Principle)
5. [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](#Dependency-Inversion-Principle)

These principles aim to make software systems more modular, flexible, and maintainable by reducing code complexity, making it easier to change and test, and reducing dependencies between components.

## Single-Responsibility-Principle
SRP stands for Single Responsibility Principle, which is a software design principle that states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have only one responsibility or job. This principle promotes modular programming, loose coupling, and high cohesion, which can improve the maintainability, flexibility, and testability of the codebase.
## Open-Closed-Principle
OCP stands for Open-Closed Principle, which is a design principle in object-oriented programming. The principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, you should be able to add new functionality to a software system without having to modify its existing code. This can be achieved by using abstraction and polymorphism. The goal of OCP is to create software that is easy to maintain, test, and extend over time.
## Liskov-Substitution-Principle
LSP stands for Liskov Substitution Principle. It is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that states that objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without causing errors or unexpected behavior in the program. The LSP is closely related to the concept of inheritance and polymorphism.
## Interface-Segregation-Principle
ISP stands for Interface Segregation Principle, one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. In other words, a class should not be forced to implement methods or interfaces that it does not need or use.
The ISP helps to ensure that code is well-organized and easy to maintain, and can prevent a system from becoming too tightly coupled, which can make it difficult to change and evolve over time. By adhering to this principle, code can be more modular, flexible, and reusable.
## Dependency-Inversion-Principle
DIP stands for Dependency Inversion Principle, which is one of the SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. It states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but instead both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details, but rather details should depend on abstractions.
In practical terms, this means that the implementation of a class or module should depend on abstractions or interfaces, rather than on specific implementations of those interfaces. This allows for greater flexibility in the code, and makes it easier to swap out different implementations of a particular interface without having to make changes throughout the entire codebase.
For example, if you have a high-level class that needs to use a low-level database access class, you could use dependency injection to pass in an interface to the database class, rather than a concrete implementation. This would allow you to easily swap out different database implementations in the future, without having to change any of the code that depends on the database access class.
In summary, the DIP principle promotes loose coupling between modules or classes, which makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain.
